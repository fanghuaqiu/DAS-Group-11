# DAS-Group-11
WELCOME!

Hi, Group 11, below is some notes for the project:

• The slides should include the aims of the analysis, exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling and results, conclusions and future work/extensions.

For Collaborative Coding & Analysis:
• Appropriate exploration of the allocated dataset using multiple exploratory techniques has been conducted and any possible patterns/anomalies have been identified. [5 marks]
• Appropriate statistical methods have been correctly applied. [10 marks]
• .Rmd file and its corresponding .pdf is tidy, reproducible and well commented [10 Marks]
• At least one branch created to look at a section of analysis. This branch should be then merged into the master branch. At least one member of the group should check the code changes, comment and approve the merge request. [2 marks]
• Demonstrate good practice of using GitHub. For example, provide meaningful commit messages, review others’ commits to the repo, keep repository organised and tidy, provide a meaningful README file. [3 marks]
